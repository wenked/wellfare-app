# Welfare Check-in SaaS Platform - Project Summary

This document summarizes the development of the Welfare Check-in SaaS Platform prototype.

## 1. What was completed?

- **Core Application Structure:** A React-based frontend using Vite and TypeScript was established.
- **User Authentication:** Full sign-up, login, and logout functionality using Supabase Auth, including context management (`AuthContext`) and protected routes.
- **Frontend UI Pages:**
  - `AuthPage`: For user sign-in and sign-up.
  - `CreateCallPage`: A form for users to input service user details (name, phone number) and a custom message to schedule a welfare check-in call.
  - `DashboardPage`: Displays a table of scheduled calls, showing their status and outcome (fetched from Supabase).
  - `NavBar`: Provides navigation between Dashboard and Create Call pages, and a logout function for authenticated users.
- **Styling:** Pages and components were styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and consistent look and feel.
- **Supabase Backend:**
  - **Database Schema:** A `call_logs` table was designed and SQL provided to store details of each call, including user information, call parameters, status, outcome, and timestamps.
  - **Edge Function (`schedule-welfare-call`):**
    - Receives call scheduling requests from the frontend.
    - Validates input (e.g., E.164 phone number format).
    - (Conceptually) Prepares a payload for a voice API (like Retell AI).
    - Makes an API call to the (conceptual) voice API to initiate the call.
    - Logs the initial call attempt and `retell_call_id` into the `call_logs` table.
  - **Edge Function (`retell-webhook-handler`):**
    - (Conceptually) Designed to receive webhook events from the voice API (e.g., Retell AI) regarding call status updates (call_started, call_ended).
    - Implements HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for webhook security.
    - Parses webhook payloads to update the `call_logs` table with status, outcome (derived from transcript parsing), call duration, and other details.
- **Error Handling & State Management:** Implemented basic loading states, error display, and success messages on relevant pages.
- **Client-Side Validation:** Added E.164 phone number validation on the `CreateCallPage` for better UX.

## 2. What was used (Tech Stack, Voice API)?

- **Frontend:**
  - React (v18) with Vite
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - React Router DOM (v6 for client-side routing)
- **Backend (PaaS):**
  - Supabase:
    - Supabase Auth (Authentication)
    - Supabase Database (PostgreSQL)
    - Supabase Edge Functions (Deno Runtime)
- **Voice API (Conceptual Integration):**
  - Retell AI (The application is structured to integrate with Retell AI for making outbound voice calls and receiving status updates via webhooks).
- **Development Environment:**
  - Node.js (v18+ recommended, user upgraded to v24)
  - npm
  - Supabase CLI

## 3. Which AI-first tools were leveraged?

- **AI Coding Assistant (Gemini):** This project was developed collaboratively with an AI coding assistant (Gemini). The assistant helped with:
  - Generating initial component structures and boilerplate.
  - Writing and refining frontend React components and Supabase Edge Functions.
  - Implementing business logic for call scheduling and webhook handling.
  - Debugging issues related to state management, routing, API integration, and CSS.
  - Suggesting solutions for common development problems (e.g., Node.js version conflicts, Tailwind CSS configuration).
  - Generating SQL schemas and Supabase policies.
  - Creating documentation (like this README).
  - Recommending best practices for security (e.g., webhook signature verification) and user experience.

## 4. What would be prioritized next if given more time?

- **Full Retell AI Integration & Testing:**
  - Complete the API call in `schedule-welfare-call` to actually trigger Retell AI calls.
  - Thoroughly test the `retell-webhook-handler` with actual Retell AI webhook events to ensure correct parsing and database updates.
  - Refine the `parseTranscriptForOutcome` logic in the webhook based on real call transcripts from Retell to accurately determine call outcomes (e.g., user pressed 1 for "OK", 2 for "Needs Assistance").
- **Enhanced User Experience & UI Polish:**
  - Implement the mobile menu for the `NavBar` for better responsiveness.
  - Add more sophisticated loading indicators (e.g., spinners) and notification systems (e.g., toast messages for success/error).
  - Improve form validation feedback on the `CreateCallPage`.
  - Allow users to clear/reset the `CreateCallPage` form after successful submission.
- **Dashboard Enhancements:**
  - Add pagination or infinite scrolling for the call logs if the list becomes long.
  - Implement filtering and sorting options for the call logs table.
  - Display more detailed call information (perhaps in a modal or a separate detail view).
  - Consider visual call analytics or summaries.
- **Core Functionality Expansion:**
  - **Recurring Calls:** Allow users to schedule recurring welfare check-in calls (e.g., daily, weekly).
  - **Call Retry Logic:** Implement logic for retrying failed calls.
  - **User Settings/Profile:** A page for users to manage their account details.
- **Robust Error Handling & Monitoring:**
  - Implement more comprehensive error handling across the application.
  - Set up logging and monitoring for Supabase Edge Functions in production.
- **Security Hardening:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of all security aspects, especially around API key management and data access policies.
- **Testing:**
  - Implement unit tests for key components and functions.
  - Conduct end-to-end testing of the user flows.
- **Code Refinement & Optimization:**
  - Further refactor code for clarity, maintainability, and performance where needed.
